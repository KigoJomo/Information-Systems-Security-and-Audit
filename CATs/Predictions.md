# Possible CAT Predictions

Here are two predictions for possible CAT (one) questions based on the course outline and existing sample CAT questions:

**Prediction 1:**

1. a) Describe the three primary goals of computer security. Provide examples for each goal.
   - [4 Marks]
   - **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that information is not accessed by unauthorized individuals. Example: Encrypting sensitive emails to prevent interception.
   - **Integrity:** Ensuring that information is not altered by unauthorized individuals. Example: Using hash functions to verify file integrity.
   - **Availability:** Ensuring that information is available when needed. Example: Implementing redundancy to prevent downtime of critical services.

   b) List and explain five common attack methods used against information systems.
   - [5 Marks]
     1. **Phishing:** Deceptive attempts to obtain sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.
     2. **Malware:** Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.
     3. **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Attacks aimed at making a system unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with traffic.
     4. **SQL Injection:** Attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in an application's software by inserting malicious SQL code.
     5. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Attacks where the attacker secretly intercepts and relays communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

   c) Identify two vulnerabilities for each of the five components of an information system mentioned in (b).

**Prediction 2:**
2. a) Explain the four aspects of risk management as they relate to the protection of data and resources in an enterprise.

- [4 Marks]
     1. **Identification:** Determining what risks exist.
     2. **Assessment:** Evaluating the severity and impact of risks.
     3. **Mitigation:** Implementing measures to reduce risks.
     4. **Monitoring:** Continuously tracking risks and their mitigations.

   b) Discuss four common motivations for companies to seek outside security help, using practical examples.

- [4 Marks]
     1. **Expertise:** Access to specialized knowledge and skills.
     2. **Cost-Efficiency:** Reducing costs associated with in-house security teams.
     3. **Advanced Tools:** Leveraging sophisticated tools and technologies.
     4. **Focus on Core Business:** Allowing companies to concentrate on their primary business functions.

   c) Provide three reasons why computer and network security is important.

- [6 Marks]
     1. **Protection of Sensitive Information:** Preventing data breaches and loss of confidential information.
     2. **Compliance with Regulations:** Ensuring adherence to legal and regulatory requirements.
     3. **Maintaining Business Continuity:** Ensuring that business operations can continue without interruption.

These predictions align with the topics covered up to the first Continuous Assessment Test (CAT) in the course outline and reflect the style and content of the initial CAT provided.
