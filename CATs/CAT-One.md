### Question 1

#### 1(a) By using two examples in each case, distinguish between vulnerability and a threat

**Vulnerability**:

- **Definition**: A vulnerability is a weakness or gap in the protection efforts of a system, which can be exploited by threats to gain unauthorized access or cause damage.
- **Examples**:
  1. **Unpatched Software**: Software that has not been updated with the latest security patches is vulnerable to known exploits.
  2. **Weak Passwords**: Using weak or easily guessable passwords makes a system vulnerable to brute force attacks.

**Threat**:

- **Definition**: A threat is any circumstance or event that has the potential to exploit vulnerabilities and cause harm to a system or organization.
- **Examples**:
  1. **Malware**: Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to a system.
  2. **Phishing Attacks**: Attempts to obtain sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity.

#### 1(b) Explain five components/assets of an information system that need to be secured

1. **Hardware**: Physical devices like servers, computers, and networking equipment.
2. **Software**: Applications and operating systems that process and manage data.
3. **Data**: Information stored, processed, and transmitted by the system.
4. **Network**: Communication channels that connect various components of the information system.
5. **People**: Users who interact with the information system and can potentially cause security breaches through negligence or malicious intent.

#### 1(c) For each of the identified assets in 1(a), identify two vulnerabilities

1. **Hardware**:
   - Physical Theft: Unauthorized individuals could steal physical devices.
   - Environmental Damage: Damage due to fire, flood, or other environmental factors.
2. **Software**:
   - Unpatched Software: Vulnerabilities in outdated software that have not been patched.
   - Code Injection: Flaws in the code that allow for injection attacks, such as SQL injection.
3. **Data**:
   - Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
   - Data Corruption: Data integrity issues caused by malware or hardware failure.
4. **Network**:
   - Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Intercepting communications between two parties.
   - Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Overloading the network to disrupt services.
5. **People**:
   - Social Engineering: Manipulating people into giving away confidential information.
   - Insider Threats: Employees with malicious intent or who act negligently.

### Question 2

#### 2(a) Explain four aspects of risk management as it relates to the protection of data and resources in an enterprise

1. **Risk Identification**: Identifying potential risks that could affect data and resources.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Implementing measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of risks.
4. **Risk Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring the environment to detect new risks and assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

#### 2(b) Using Demonstration, outline any four common motivations for companies to seek outside security help

1. **Lack of Expertise**: Companies may not have the necessary in-house expertise to handle complex security issues.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Outsourcing can be more cost-effective than maintaining a full-time security team.
3. **Access to Advanced Tools**: External security firms often have access to the latest tools and technologies.
4. **Focus on Core Business**: Outsourcing security allows companies to focus on their core business activities without being distracted by security concerns.

#### 2(c) Explain any three reasons why computer and network security is important

1. **Protection of Sensitive Data**: Ensures that sensitive information like personal data and financial records are not compromised.
2. **Maintaining Business Continuity**: Prevents disruptions to business operations due to security incidents.
3. **Compliance with Regulations**: Helps companies comply with legal and regulatory requirements regarding data protection.

### Question 3

#### 3(a) What are eight indications that your computer may be compromised?

1. **Slow Performance**: The computer is significantly slower than usual.
2. **Unusual Pop-ups**: Frequent and unusual pop-up messages.
3. **Unfamiliar Programs**: Unknown programs running on the system.
4. **Unusual Network Activity**: Unexpected spikes in network activity.
5. **Disabled Security Software**: Antivirus or other security software is disabled without your action.
6. **Unauthorized Account Activity**: Accounts showing activity you did not perform.
7. **Changes to Files**: Files being modified or deleted without your knowledge.
8. **Unusual Error Messages**: Frequent system or application error messages.

#### 3(b) You have recently been appointed network system admin in a bank. Using illustrations, discuss possible tools that you can use to protect networks, servers, and clients in a bank

1. **Firewalls**: Tools like Cisco ASA or pfSense to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic.
2. **Antivirus/Antimalware**: Software like Symantec or McAfee to protect against malicious software.
3. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Tools like Snort to monitor and detect potential intrusions.
4. **Encryption**: Tools like OpenSSL to encrypt data in transit and at rest.
5. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Systems like Splunk to aggregate and analyze security data from across the network.
6. **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**: Solutions like OpenVPN to secure remote access to the bank's network.

#### 3(c) Explain three reasons why, even if biometrics are the most effective form of identification, they are however rarely used

1. **Cost**: Implementing biometric systems can be expensive due to the need for specialized hardware and software.
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Users may have concerns about the storage and use of their biometric data.
3. **False Positives/Negatives**: Biometric systems can sometimes produce errors, leading to false positives or negatives, which can be problematic in secure environments.
